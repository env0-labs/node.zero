# node.zero

A playable command-line learning environment built on top of [env0.core](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core).

The goal is to teach core terminal skills, basic networking, and safe failure through exploration. The experience is designed to feel authentic, not gamified â€” a supportive space to learn by doing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept
- Teach core terminal skills and network basics
- Encourage exploration and experimentation
- Provide a safe space to fail and learn
- Simulated tools (`ls`, `nmap`, etc.) over real OS interaction

## ðŸ§  Origin

`node.zero` was the seed.  
It began with a few files and an idea: teach the command line through simulation. That idea became the engine, then the lab. Itâ€™s still the heart of this ecosystem â€” just no longer the whole thing.

## ðŸš§ Status

**Conceptual at this stage.** Design notes, folders, and intent exist, but no live game logic is implemented yet.
