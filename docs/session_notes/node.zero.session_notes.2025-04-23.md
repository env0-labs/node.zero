# node.zero Session Notes — 2025-04-23

## Scope and Behavior

- node.zero will retain a pure terminal learning simulation structure.
- No conversational interface, shadow voice, or emotional narrative elements.
- Player behavior is not tracked for emotional analysis.

## Accessibility

- Keyboard/mouse interaction only — no touchscreen, controller, or click-based narrative support is planned.
- Built strictly as a CLI teaching tool with controlled command execution.

## Content Strategy

- Will use `env0.core`'s standard filesystem, fake commands (`ls`, `cat`, etc.), and structured progression.
- No psychological elements, no horror theming.
