# node.zero

A command-line learning simulation built on top of [`env0.core`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core).  
This is not a game. Itâ€™s a fake system that teaches real concepts through interaction, exploration, and failure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Introduce users to terminal fundamentals in a safe, simulated environment
- Teach core CLI tools (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `ping`, etc.) without real system access
- Use story-lite missions and filesystem structure to guide discovery
- Build confidence through structured friction, not gamified hand-holding

## ðŸ§  Origin

`node.zero` was the original project â€” the seed that became the lab.  
It started with three files.  
It grew into `env0.core`, a full terminal engine.  
Now it returns to its purpose: helping people *learn the system by using the system*.

## ðŸ§ª Current Status

**In development.**  
Design notes and architecture are in place.  
No user-ready mission content or polish exists â€” yet.
